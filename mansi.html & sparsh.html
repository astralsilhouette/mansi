            <p>My Dearest Mansi, my baby,</p>
            <p>You are the person, after meeting I realized what actually love is. It was just a normal day, <strong>14th of November</strong> lol, but now I don’t think ki it was normal.. I consider it as one of the best days of my life. Mhmmm then us din se hi idk why but i was feeling so good talking to you late night.. or us din se hi as the days kept going.. the love for you in my heart kept increasing.</p>
            <p>Remember the Nathdwar trip? That was the day I flirted with u and you said ki you wanna kiss me.. i felt frozen for a moment and the love in my heart for you increased more! Fir aise hi we kept talking.. texting each other… or fir ek din i asked you for your number.. you were like “can i trust you” lmao, then u gave it to me and lol we started texting on WhatsApp from that day. We were also texting on discord, aise hi it was going all good.</p>
            <p>And then one day you were talking about your crush.. then u said ki it’s me.. I really felt so good us time and then i said you ki u r my crush too.. then we both proposed each other and accepted lol! Then from that day we see many things co-incidencing in our life lol. Our first call was so awkward for me (wo toh abhi bhi krta hu lol), but your voice, even if you didn't say much then, became my favorite sound.</p>
            <p>Baby, I love to explain about how was my day to you and also like to listen how was urs. Your voice just makes my day. Ik 3 din se baat nhi hui h (at times) but that’s fine (not ig lmao) tumhre ghar pe ik.. toh dw abt that. Text me bhi i feel so good talking to you. And baby lastly i wanna say ki I love you so much itna ki tum soch bhi nhi skti <span class="emoji">🤧</span><span class="emoji">😭</span>.. i just don’t know how to express it (i’ll do that irl<span class="emoji">💀</span>)..</p>
            <p>Or sometimes ik I messed up with things but you always forgive me ik.. (lekin bhaut requests krni padti h lol). Or mhmm I’ll start studying from today lol… (pakka!). And once again.. I love you so muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, never gonna make u feel sad or anything like that in ur life and I trust you so so so much like.. infinitely i can say or bhi jyada ik.. even if you talk to some guy that’ll just like normal friends.. not gonna go close to anyone ik.. and me bhi aisa kuch nhi krunga like never-gonna betray ur trust… and once again I love you so much, my Mansi. <span class="emoji">❤️</span></p>
            <p>You are my Sparsh of light in this ManshVerse, the reason for every "lmao" and every "<span class="emoji">😭</span><span class="emoji">💖</span>".</p>
