            <h2>That "Normal" Day... Not Anymore! (14th Nov 2024)</h2>
            <p>It was just a normal day, <strong>14th November 2024</strong>, or so I thought lmao. Little did I know it was gonna be one of the best days of my life. From that day, talking to you late night... idk why, baby, but I was feeling SO good. And as days went by, the love for you in my heart just kept growing... 📈❤️</p>

            <h2>Confessions & Nathdwar Memories (Early Dec 2024)</h2>
            <p>Remember when you went on that Nathdwar trip? That was memorable lol. That day, <strong>1st December 2024</strong>, I just couldn't hold it in anymore and confessed I loved you. And then you flirted back, saying you wanted to kiss me... I felt frozen for a moment, man, and the love for you just EXPLODED! 😭 Then on <strong>3rd December 2024</strong>, you, my baby, asked ME to be your boyfriend! Best. Day. Ever. Our ManshVerse officially began! ✨</p>

            <h2>Crushes, Numbers & That First Awkward Call (lol)</h2>
            <p>We kept talking, texting on Discord... then I finally asked for your number. You were like, "Can I trust you?" lmao. Of course you can, baby! So we started texting on WhatsApp. Then that day you were talking about your crush... and said IT'S ME! 🤯 I was so happy, told you you're my crush too! We proposed, we accepted, boom! Relationship goals, right there. Then our first call on <strong>5th December 2024</strong> (ish, lol, dates are hard 😭). I was stuttering so much, aur tum toh kuch boli hi nhi thhi lmao! But it was perfect.</p>

            <h2>Monthly Anniversaries & Growing Closer</h2>
            <p>Our <strong>first monthly milestone (14th Dec 2024)</strong> was super special... we shared so much, got even closer, and yeah, that abs reveal happened lmao 👀. Then, our <strong>second monthly milestone (14th Jan 2025)</strong>, our first VC! Seeing your face, baby, made my heart do backflips. Every day, explaining my day to you, hearing about yours, your voice... it just makes my day. The love between us just started getting stronger and stronger... (if that's correct lmao).</p>

            <h2>Through Thick & Thin (Six Months & Beyond - 14th May 2025)</h2>
            <p>Bangalore to Jaipur is a long way, yr, and I miss you SO much (hope you miss me too 🤧). We've faced hindrances, stuff has happened, but look at us now, baby! Six months together as of <strong>14th May 2025</strong>! Our love is a universe, constantly expanding. This ManshVerse is for you, to show you a glimpse of how much I love you. It's a place for our dreams – exploring galaxies, stargazing from Saturn’s rings, hugging under pink auroras... just us. 🌌</p>
